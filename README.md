Learning Progression-Guided AI Evaluation of Scientific Models To Support Diverse Multi-Modal Understanding in NGSS Classroom

Learning Progressions (LPs) can help adjust instruction to individual learners’ needs if the LPs
reflect diverse ways of thinking about a construct being measured, and if the LP-aligned
assessments meaningfully measure this diversity. The process of doing science is inherently
multi-modal with scientists utilizing drawings, writing and other modalities to explain
phenomena. Thus, fostering deep science understanding requires supporting students in using
multiple modalities when explaining phenomena. We build on a validated NGSS-aligned
multi-modal LP reflecting diverse ways of modeling and explaining electrostatic phenomena and
associated assessments. We focus on students’ modeling, an essential practice for building a deep
science understanding. Supporting culturally and linguistically diverse students in building
modeling skills provides them with an alternative mode of communicating their understanding,
essential for equitable science assessment. Machine learning (ML) has been used to score
open-ended modeling tasks (e.g., drawings), and short text-based constructed scientific
explanations, both of which are time- consuming to score. We use ML to evaluate LP-aligned
scientific models and the accompanying short text-based explanations reflecting multi-modal
understanding of electrical interactions in high school Physical Science. We show how LP guides
the design of personalized ML-driven feedback grounded in the diversity of student thinking on
both assessment modes.
